## Description
This folder contains all the scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization related to the single-cell transcriptomic analysis of zebrafish pigment cells.

## Contents
- **analise_remota_scripts.Rmd:** Script for remote analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data.
- **memory_optimization_scripts.Rmd:** Script focused on memory optimization techniques for handling large single-cell RNA-seq datasets.
- **UMAP_simple.Rmd:** Script for performing UMAP dimensionality reduction on single-cell RNA-seq data.

## Usage
Run the scripts in the specified order to reproduce the analysis and visualizations. Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.

## Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary computational resources, as some scripts may require significant memory and processing power.
- Refer to the individual script headers for specific instructions and details.
