## Project Description
- **Advisor:** David Henriques â€“ CSIC IIM (Vigo, Spain)
- **Title:** Visualization of Single-Cell Transcriptomics from Zebrafish Pigment Cells

### Abstract
This project utilizes single-cell transcriptomics techniques to investigate cell type lineages and visualize key genetic markers of pigment cell differentiation. With tools such as Monocle and Slingshot, we aim to deepen our understanding of cell proliferation and the factors influencing the pigmentation of zebrafish.

### Objectives
1. Identify cell type lineages in zebrafish single-cell transcriptomics.
2. Visualize key genetic markers of pigment cell differentiation.
